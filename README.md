## Avro (অভ্র) for Chrome . Write Bangla instantly.
Avro (অভ্র) extension for chrome works with any chromium based browser that supports installing extensions from chrome web store.

## Features: 

 - It works offline. 
 - It's fast and instant, there is no round trip delay for processing every word you type. 
 - It values privacy. Whatever you  write or save in the drafts don't leave your browser unless you want them to.
